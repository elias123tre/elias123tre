# 🛠 Skills

## 💻 Technology

### Python 🐍

My comfort language. What I use to make everything from quick scripts and calculations to full blown apps and servers. Comfortable with Flask, Pandas, Numpy, SQLite databases and more. Web-scraping knowledge with for example requests, BeautifulSoup, Puppeteer and Playwright.

### Javascript/Typescript 🌐

I am a passionate web developer and have experience with Node.js, React, Next.js, Vue, Express, jQuery, Electron and plenty more frameworks. But I also admire the beauty of vanilla HTML/CSS/JS while employing modern web standards (looking into the growing Remix framework).

### Rust 🦀

Had my eye on Rust for a long time and absolutely loved it when introduced to it when studying at KTH. I fancy it when writing stable, runtime-secure servers and performance critical algorithms. A joy to write programs in!

### PHP 🐘

PHP has it’s flaws but I still think it has its place in simple front-end integrated API’s and forms. I have experience writing Wordpress plugins & themes and understandably also MySQL database queries but also full-blown sites.

### Java

Learned through courses at both my Gymnasium and KTH. If confronted with it today I will probably learn to use Kotlin instead.

### Go

Haven’t used it a lot but I love to use it for heavily threaded workloads. Asynchronous apps on integrated circuits is another use-case.

### C#

Some .NET experience with mainly Windows Forms. Would love to learn Unity.

### C/C++

Learned from a course in integrated circuits and low-level systems programming.

## 💿 Software

### Google Sheets/Microsoft Excel

My first experience with programming was with very advanced formulas for Google Sheets that later transitioned into scripts. Documented all my grades with formulas and graphs for calculating and visualizing scores (similar to GPA).

### Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere

I love the concept of SVG and vector graphics and therefore enjoy editing and creating in Illustrator. Can for example mask, filter and erase objects in Photoshop. I’ve done some basic video editing in Premiere with some additional effects.

### Figma

I’ve made plenty of interactive, detailed prototypes for both hobby projects, work and school. I know the tool very well and can rapidly make sketches of my ideas.

### AutoDesk Inventor, AutoCAD, Fusion 360

A couple of my gymnasium courses taught both Inventor and AutoCAD for parameterized stress analysis and 3D sketching. I’ve used Fusion 360 for hobby projects and 3D printing.

## ☁️ Cloud infrastructure

### Cloudflare Workers

HTTP Microservices, REST, CRUD APIs and more.

### Google Cloud

Flask server, python and shell scripting.

### AWS

Used S3 for website hosting (with API gateway) and made a few AWS Lambda scripts

# Current hobby project

My latest hobby project revolves around a Ubuntu server I have installed at home with multiple web servers, socket server, reverse-proxy and more. Designed to be resilient to power loss etc. It uses Websockets, TCP, MQTT, NGINX and communicates with a Raspberry Pi and some smart-home devices.
